Hi, I’m Marcel Schutte — a passionate solution architect from the Netherlands with a strong focus on pragmatic design, software architecture, and knowledge sharing.

I work at Sogeti, one of the leading IT companies in the Netherlands, where I’m part of a vibrant Java community. Here I help clients with a wide range of architectural challenges - from designing future-proof systems to aligning IT with business goals.

Outside of my role at Sogeti, I regularly speak at conferences like Devoxx, TEQNation, and JFall. My talks focus on software architecture and the growing impact of AI on our work as architects and tech leaders.

{% include pullquote.html quote="I believe in practical solutions, clear communication, and enabling teams to make better, faster decisions." %} My presentations, blogs, and workshops reflect this mindset — less theory, more value.

When I’m not working or presenting, you’ll find me running, geocaching, gardening, or playing badminton. I enjoy exploring new ideas — whether in tech or in nature.

Thanks for visiting!
