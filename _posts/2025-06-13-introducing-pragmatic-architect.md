Hey there – welcome to Pragmatic Architect, this site is my personal corner of the internet to share thoughts, ideas, and lessons learned about software architecture.

It’s where I’m figuring out what modern, down-to-earth architecture looks like — and how we can make it work in the real world.

You’ll also find my talks, articles, and other stuff I’ve made along the way. Think of it as part blog, part portfolio, part playground.

If you're into practical, no-nonsense architecture, you're in the right place. Glad to have you here!
